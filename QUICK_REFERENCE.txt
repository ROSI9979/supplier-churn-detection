SUPPLIER CHURN DETECTION SYSTEM - QUICK REFERENCE
==================================================

RISK SCORING METHODOLOGY:
• Spending Trend (35%): Linear regression on monthly spending
• Recent Decline (35%): Comparison of recent vs historical averages
• Inactivity (20%): Number of months with zero spending
• Volatility (10%): Erratic purchasing patterns

RISK LEVELS:
• 🔴 HIGH RISK (70-100): Immediate action required
  Recommended: 15% discount + personalized outreach
  
• 🟠 MEDIUM RISK (45-69): Monitor closely
  Recommended: 8-12% discount + periodic check-ins
  
• 🟢 LOW RISK (0-44): Stable customers
  Recommended: Standard retention

KEY OUTPUTS:
1. customer_metrics.csv - Full metrics for all customers
2. product_risk_analysis.csv - Which products are being lost
3. retention_strategies.csv - Specific actions per customer
4. churn_report.json - Complete analysis in JSON format

DATABASE TABLES:
• transactions - All customer purchases
• customer_metrics - Calculated churn scores
• churn_predictions - Recommended actions
• retention_actions - History of interventions

TO QUERY THE DATABASE:
from database import SupplierDatabase
db = SupplierDatabase('supplier_churn.db')
high_risk = db.get_high_risk_customers()
recommendations = db.get_retention_recommendations()

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review high-risk customers in churn_report.json
2. Implement retention actions for URGENT priority customers
3. Offer recommended discounts on at-risk products
4. Track outcomes in retention_actions table
5. Re-run analysis monthly to identify new at-risk customers
